    <div>In order to display this technology, we needed to find artists that freely
    allow their music to be shared with the world in exchange that no profit it made from
    their art. First of all, we thank them.</div><br>

    <div>There are many technologists in the world that love music and technology so much,
    that they freely create software for others to enjoy it. I would like to thank them as well.</div><br>

    <small>The Grateful Dead and our managing organizations have long encouraged the purely non-commercial exchange of music taped at our concerts and those of our individual members. That a new medium of distribution has arisen - digital audio files being traded over the Internet - does not change our policy in this regard. Our stipulations regarding digital distribution are merely extensions of those long-standing principles and they are as follow: No commercial gain may be sought by websites offering digital files of our music, whether through advertising, exploiting databases compiled from their traffic, or any other means. All participants in such digital exchange acknowledge and respect the copyrights of the performers, writers and publishers of the music. This notice should be clearly posted on all sites engaged in this activity. We reserve the ability to withdraw our sanction of non-commercial digital music should circumstances arise that compromise our ability to protect and steward the integrity of our work.</small>
